1.2 Problem statement 
For the Thrash and Treasure Platform, the Incremental Process Model is selected as the software process model. This model divides the development process into smaller, manageable increments, allowing the team to focus on delivering functional components at each stage. It is well-suited for this project because of the platform's diverse functionalities, such as user registration, inventory management, order processing, and reporting, which can be developed and deployed incrementally. The model also facilitates early feedback from stakeholders, iterative improvements, and parallel development of modules, ensuring that critical features are prioritized while maintaining flexibility to adapt to changes. This approach minimizes risks and enables faster delivery of working features, making it ideal for the platform’s development timeline. This platform is valuable for everyone because it enables the transformation of discarded items into valuable assets, turning “trash” into “treasure” through innovative reuse and repurposing. Nevertheless, this platform promotes creativity and resourcefulness, helping users discover new value in goods while advancing a circular economy.
1.3 Project Plan 



2 System Overview
2.1 Description

The Thrash and Treasure Platform is an advanced online marketplace designed to seamlessly connect users for buying, selling, and trading items. By focusing on sustainability, the platform enables the reuse and repurposing of goods, turning what might be considered "thrash" into valuable "treasure." The platform supports four main user roles: Buyer, Seller, Admin, and Logistics Manager, each equipped with tools to ensure efficient operations.

With a secure registration and authentication process, users gain personalized accounts tailored to their roles. Buyers can explore a diverse catalog using advanced search and filtering features, place orders, and track their purchases in real-time. Sellers manage inventory effortlessly by adding, updating, or removing items, aided by automated restocking alerts to maintain stock levels. Admins oversee system operations, manage user activity, and generate insightful reports for informed decision-making. Logistics Managers ensure timely deliveries by tracking and updating order statuses.

Offering features like inventory control, order processing, real-time notifications, and data analytics, the platform delivers a streamlined, user-friendly experience. By championing sustainability, it promotes creativity and resourcefulness, helping users discover new value in goods while advancing a circular economy.

2.3 Assumptions and Dependencies
a) Role Selection During Registration:
During registration, users can select only from the Buyer or Seller roles. These roles define access to specific features: Buyers access customer-facing tools like browsing and purchasing, while Sellers manage inventory and orders. It is assumed that users will provide accurate and complete information during registration, especially Sellers, who must input business-related details such as store name and address.

b) Logistics Manager Role Assignment:
The Logistics Manager role is not selectable during registration and must be manually assigned by the Admin. It is assumed that Admins will manage this role responsibly, assigning it to trusted personnel or vetted external partners and providing accurate delivery zones and credentials.

c) User Roles and Permissions:
The platform assumes that role-based access control will be correctly implemented and enforced, ensuring users can access only the features and data relevant to their roles. For example, sellers cannot access admin tools.

d) Inventory Stock Levels:
Sellers are expected to maintain accurate inventory levels. It is assumed that any inventory changes, such as adding or restocking items, will be promptly updated in the system to prevent overselling or order cancellations.

e) Delivery Zones for Logistics Managers:
Admins are assumed to define and assign delivery zones accurately for Logistics Managers to ensure efficient and clear delivery operations.

f) Device Compatibility:
Users are assumed to access the platform via web browsers on devices with up-to-date software for compatibility. The platform also assumes users have stable internet access.

g) User Behavior:
Users are expected to comply with platform rules and provide accurate information. Misuse or incorrect data may disrupt operations and require Admin intervention.

5.2 Data Dictionary
<TO DO: Describe the data dictionary and place the table with the details here>

The Data Dictionary for the Thrash and Treasure Platform provides a detailed and structured definition of the database design, covering key entities such as Users, Products, Orders, Payments, Feedback, and Logistics. Each table consists of unique attributes with specified data types, formats, constraints, and relationships to ensure data integrity and consistency. Primary keys (PK) and foreign keys (FK) are clearly identified to establish connections between tables, facilitating efficient data retrieval and relational integrity. For example, the User table includes essential attributes like User_ID, User_Name, Email, and Password, while the Order table links to User_ID to track orders placed by specific users. The design also incorporates comprehensive content descriptions, such as product reviews, payment methods, feedback responses, and logistics tasks, ensuring that the platform captures all necessary details for smooth operations. Overall, this well-structured database design enhances data accuracy, supports key functionalities, and provides a robust foundation for implementing the platform's business processes.
